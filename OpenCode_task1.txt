    in keeping track of the changes made in the file (any change like creation,modification,deletion

3.  pull request is a feature by which any team member can request the project manager to pull a branch from
    your repository to their repository but pull request allows other features as well because other team
    members can contribute and commit if the branch lacks anything 
    

    basically a pull request is just a request to merge the branch made by the team member to the main branch
    the main branch is not affected if  the side branches does not function properly.
   
    EXPLANTATION FOR MAKING A PULL REQUEST

    for pulling request go to your github and then open the required repository and on then from the list select
    pull request and you will see which branches are ready to be merged to the main branch .
